### [Gajim](https://gajim.org)

#### Install using Git

If you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/dracula/gajim.git

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub .zip download](https://github.com/dracula/gajim/archive/master.zip) option and unzip them.

#### Activating theme on Linux

For some desktop environments it's enough to activate the Dracula [GTK](https://draculatheme.com/gtk) or [qt](https://draculatheme.com/qt5) theme.

If this is not enough you **also** need to:

1. Copy `dracula.css` to `~/.config/gajim/theme/`
2. Restart Gajim
3. Dracula will be available under `Gajim > Preferences > Style > Theme`
